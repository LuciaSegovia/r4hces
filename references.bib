  abstract = {High-quality food composition data are crucial to obtain adequate results in research education, health claims and policy decisions. This publication targets compilers and users of food composition tables and databases working for example in ministries and government entities, academic and research institutions, and private and public sector institutions dealing with nutrition, agriculture or health. It will assist them in easily evaluating food composition tables and databases and advocate the importance of their high quality to decision makers. This user guide provides background information on the development of an evaluation framework, its objectives and underlying methodology, as well as an overview of the criteria and scoring system.},
