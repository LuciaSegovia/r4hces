## 4. Harmonising the Food Composition Tables

When all the FCTs are standardised, we can use them all together, hence if a food item is missing in Tanzania FCT, 2008, then a similar food item will be found in another FCT. 

### 4.1. Food matching

After the FCTs are standardised and harmonised and the food list (i.e., food reported as consumed in the NPS-DSS 2019-2020), we can proceed to match them together. To do so, we are using a standardised list of foods that we called "food dictionary". As depicted in the @fig-matching.

## Activity 2: Thinking about food matches between HCES food list and food composition.

:::


```{r}


```


 1. Do you think that the food matches selected represents well what it is consumed in Tanzania?
 2. If not, what other foods would you add/remove/change to? 
 3. For the foods without matches, can you think of what food items you would use?
 4. Could you identify any food matches in the Tanzania FCT, 2008 that will be a good match for those foods that have no matches? 
 5. What nutrients are important for each of the foods selected?
