# Food composition harmonisation and food matching

## Introduction


### Food matching

After the FCTs are standardised and harmonised and the food list (i.e., food reported as consumed in the Integrated Household Survey, Wave 5, 2019-2020), we can proceed to match them together. To do so, we are using a standardised list of foods that we called "food dictionary". As depicted in the @fig-matching.

## Harmonising the Food Composition Tables

When all the FCTs are standardised, we can use them all together, which is particularly useful when food items and/or nutrient values are missing in the main FCT, then a similar food item could be found in another FCT.

## Getting the Nutrition Tools

NutritionTools is an R package of functions to help with a wide range of calculations and processes that commonly occur when working with nutrition datasets. More information can be found [here](https://tomcodd.github.io/NutritionTools/).

```{r}

if (!require("devtools")) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("TomCodd/NutritionTools")

```
